# Overview

The firmware examples aim to demonstrate how to communicate with the hardware at the simplest possible level.

Consider the code samples as examples on how to communicate with peripherals board, not detailed tutorials for how to use Dynamixel servos, Cybergears or the BNO055 IMU etc. The README files accompanying each sample contains a resources chapter with links to relevant documentation and data sheets where control registers, commands and frame formats are documented in detail.

All firmware examples are written in Go, but the same examples are trivial to implement in other languages (C, C++, Python etc)

The example code together with online protocol documentation should be enough to get you started.
