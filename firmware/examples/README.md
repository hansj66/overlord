# Overview

The firmware examples aim to demonstrate how to communicate with the hardware at the simplest possible level. . 

Consider them examples on how to communicate with peripherals board, not tutorials for how to use Dynamixel servos, Cybergears or the BNO055 IMU etc.

The servo examples aim to demonstrate communication at the simplest possible level (by banging together a viable frame and scanning the servo bus/network).

The same goes for the gamepad and IMU examples.

All firmware examples are written in Go, but the same examples are trivial to implement in other languages (C, C++, Python etc)

The example code together with online protocol documentation should be enough to get you started.
